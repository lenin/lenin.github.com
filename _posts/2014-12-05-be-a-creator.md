title: Be a creator
---

People. We always want what we can't have. I used to crave things like gadgets, cellphones, laptops, videogames. I spent an immense amount of time thinking about what it would be like to own that new thing, and that my life would be so much better if I could just have it in my hands. What a waste of energy.

Sometimes we can't afford the new thing we want, but other times we can, and what you'll find is that your life really isn't that much better by you having this new stuff. In fact, it's pretty much the same, so what's all the fuzz about? Why did you get so excited? It really is a big disappointment. And so after a few experiences like that, you stop caring so much about having new things.

Needless to say, your life can really improve after that. You won't be constantly stressing about having to buy something new, doing the research on the thing, constantly wondering if you're going to be able to spend the money it costs, making rationalizations to justify buying it. All that is gone.

If you manage to control these urges to consume new things, you'll find yourself with a kind of inner peace. Whenever you see something that you know would've been the object of your obsession before, you can feel really proud of yourself that you can now say "I don't care". You know your life is good, and a new TV isn't really going to improve it, not by that much anyway. It's not worth it.

I do buy new things from time to time, but I don't obsess about it anymore. If the time is right, and I have sufficient funds, I buy it and enjoy.

I find the concept of being more of a creator than a consumer, really appealing. We're always consuming all kinds of things, like food, entertainment, TV shows, music, books, movies, art. And it's all great, there are a lot of great things out there that make life better. But we must also create things.

Ever since I made my first program in VB6, I remember thinking "wow, I can create anything with this". I see software development as an act of creation, and I feel really fortunate to be able to do it. But I also want to create more and consume less. So I'm betting on writing to be my next tool of creation.

There are a lot of ways in which you can participate in the act of creation as well, like writing, painting, singing, playing an instrument, and a lot more.

So instead of always wanting what you don't have, and always being on the consumer side, try to do some creation yourself. Create things that are beautiful, or that help other people, or that help you. Create things that are a combination of other things, or entirely new things that the world has never seen.

Be a creator, and just have fun.
