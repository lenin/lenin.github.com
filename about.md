Hey, I'm Lenin. I'm a software developer. I spend most of my time writing code, but I also like to do other things like play basketball, lift weights, play guitar, contemplate the emptiness of the universe from my meditation chamber, and enjoy life in general.

I'm located in Culiacán, Sinaloa, México, which is where I currently work from home. I enjoy the discipline required to be productive working from home, and lately I've been experimenting with different habits to form a daily routine that'll allow me to do all the things I want to get done.

My life's purpose is to enjoy every moment with my wife Ana, and my son Alexander. I'd like to take them everywhere in the world, and I hope some day my son will be ten times better than me at all he does. Better start teaching him the dark arts of full stack web & mobile development.

I'd like to have at least one side project at all times, a hobby side project that is, so I guess this site will be an attempt at that, and hopefully just one from a few. So many things to do, and so many new technologies to try, it's really hard to decide where to start.
